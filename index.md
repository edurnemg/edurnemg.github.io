# Hi there!

My name is Edurne (Eddie) Morillo and I'm a journalist passionate about coding, data and viz. I am currently enrolled in an [MSc in Computational and Data Journalism](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/taught/courses/course/computational-and-data-journalism-msc) at Cardiff University (UK).

Before, I worked as an international journalist in some amazing countries like Kenya and Japan, as well as my home country: Spain. I'm open to opportunities, so please contact me at [edurne.morillo[at]pm.me](mailto:edurne.morillo@pm.me) or my Twitter account [(@EdurneMG)](https://twitter.com/EdurneMG).
